# terpscraper
a little python script i wrote to scrape Trulieve's website and print out all the test results it finds for any type of product

you need to put the websites "main id="maincontent" class="page-main"" html element into a file named links.txt in the same folder as both .py files

run terpinput, it will output outlinks.txt

run terpscraper, it will use outlinks.txt as input and output coalist.txt

terppdf currently only takes a pdf from your files and extracts all the text
