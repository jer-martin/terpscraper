# terpscraper
a little python script i wrote to scrape Trulieve's website and print out all the test results it finds for any type of product

you need to put the websites "main id="maincontent" class="page-main"" html element into a file named links.txt in the same folder as both .py files

run terpinput, it will output outlinks.txt

run terpscraper, it will use outlinks.txt as input and output coalist.txt
