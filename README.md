# terpscraper
a little python script i wrote to scrape Trulieve's website and print out all the flower test results it finds

you need to put the websites entire html code into links.txt in the same folder as both .py files

run terpinput, it will output outlinks.txt

run terpscraper, it will use outlinks.txt as input and output coalist.txt
